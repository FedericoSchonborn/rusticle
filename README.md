# Rusticle

Do Rust's short keywords confuse you? Are you tired of Rust not being verbose enough? Or worrying
you are not using your new shiny mechanical keyboard enough?

**Then Rusticle is your solution!**

Using the innovative technology of Procedural Macro Magic:tm:, you can turn this unintelligible
mess...

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

...into this long and nice, enterprise-grade yet beginner-friendly art piece:

```rust
rusticle::rusticle! {
    // Thank Ferris now it's clear this is a function!
    function main() {
        printline!("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

Not only that, Rusticle can replace all of the following identifiers into their intended meanings:

```rust
async  => asynchronous
const  => constant
dyn    => dynamic
enum   => enumeration
extern => external
fn     => function
impl   => implement
let    => lettuce
mod    => module
mut    => mutable
pub    => public
ref    => byreference
self   => itself
Self   => Itself
struct => structure
super  => superior
use    => using
```

All for the low price of **$0.00**.

_YES, YOU HEARD IT RIGHT! **ZERO POINT ZERO ZERO DOLLARS!**_
